Date : 1/9/2025
Objective :Design an API with 4 endpoints based on mini challenges from the Combine:

    -each endpoint must have their own Controller file, inside a Controller folder
    -Also, each one must have their own service file, inside a Service folder
    -Validation is required.


Endpoints:
Design an API based on mini challenges from the Combine:

    Also, each one must have their own service file, inside a Service folder
    Data Validation is required.


Endpoints:

1. Magic 8 Ball: create a endpoint generates 8 unique responses. One controller


2. Guess It: create 3 endpoints (one controller) that takes an input, then outputs if the number is higher or lower than the number guessed.

    Easy Mode 1-10
    Medium Mode 1-50
    Hard Mode 1-100


3. Restaurant Picker: create 1 endpoint that takes an input and generates a Randomly Generated Restaurant based on the category chosen. 10 Restaurants per category.

### Peer Review by: Alexander Soria
Your endpoints work exactly as intended. However, Guess It had to be comprised of 3 endpoints tied to one controller, and it seems you only made one endpoint for Guess It. Other than that, everything else looks good.
